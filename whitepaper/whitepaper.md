## Executive Summary

A conceptual meaning layer for AI systems

This white paper introduces Resonance Quantum Layer as a foundational conceptual framework 
within the Resonance Data and Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC) paradigm.

---

## 1. Motivation

Current AI systems are excellent at:
- Storing information
- Computing similarity
- Generating responses

However, they cannot:
- Stabilize insight over time
- Preserve wisdom as coherent meaning
- Model decisions beyond ranking

Resonance Quantum Layer addresses this gap conceptually.

## 2. Definition

**Resonance Quantum Layer (RQL)** is defined as:

A conceptual meaning layer for AI systems

### What This IS

- A conceptual framework for understanding meaning dynamics
- A theoretical model within the Resonance Data paradigm
- A non-operational, dissertation-level contribution
- Part of the VEGA Continuum

### What This IS NOT

- NOT an algorithm or implementation
- NOT a claim of new physics
- NOT quantum hardware or quantum supremacy
- NOT consciousness, sentience, or autonomous intelligence

---

## 3. Theoretical Framework

### Relationship to Resonance Data

Resonance Quantum Layer operates within the Resonance Data (RD) framework where:
- Meaning is modeled as a resonant state
- Relevance emerges from resonance strength
- Memory persists through repeated coherence

### Relationship to QIRC

Within Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing:
- **Superposition**: Multiple meaning states coexist
- **Interference**: Relevance is amplified or cancelled
- **Resonance Collapse**: Decision as state selection

---

## 5. Contribution

Resonance Quantum Layer establishes prior art for a novel conceptual framework 
while preserving future implementation freedom.
